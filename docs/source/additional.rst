Knowledge in these area will aid in understanding applications of FPGAs.
Because it is versatile, it is also a cross-section of many different engineering subjects/topics.
NOTE ONLY COVER THAT WHICH YOU'VE DONE. 
other areas will be brief.

Data Structure

try to implement or think about everything with a RAM. what are the challenge, limitations, is it even worth

stack - LIFO, last in first out. push pop. max size/ top. stack/frame pointer. check overflow underflow 
which is the same as checking full vs. empty in our fifos.
    back tracking, depth first search.

queue - FIFO, first in first out. first come first serve. enqueue, dequeue
read write counter pointers, empty, full flags 

hash table
From wiki..
In computing, a hash table, also known as a hash map, is a data structure that implements an associative array, also called a dictionary, which is an abstract data type that maps keys to values.[2] A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. During lookup, the key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the corresponding value is stored.
In many situations, hash tables turn out to be on average more efficient than search trees or any other table lookup structure. For this reason, they are widely used in many kinds of computer software, particularly for associative arrays, database indexing, caches, and sets.

associative array.. 2D array. one row key. other row data. key and data correspond to the index.

sparse matrix
binary search tree

the above are definitely things that can be implemented in HDL/hardware.

heap 

do i reallly need to know lists?
maybe revisit comp arch to see which of the comsci can be applied

Algorithm
##########################
At the heart of everything are algorithms. and state machines.
breadth first serach

O(1) - Excellent/Best, independent..
O(log n) - Good, cut in half
O(n) - Fair, for loops
O(n log n) - Bad, loops of cut in half lol
O(n^2), O(2^n) and O(n!) - Horrible/Worst, nested loops
