At the time of writing, focused on Xilinx FPGAs.

What is an FPGA
***********************
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are semiconductor devices with pre-defined available logic blocks and programmable interconnect. 
Your job as a developer is to make the interonnection between these blocks resulting in the functionality or task specific to your application. 



Why FPGA
***********************
Reconfigurability, parallelism, throughput.
I think we have to say throughput, because there are chips faster, but they don't or aren't capable of taking advantage of parallism.

When FPGA
**********************************************
In general, it depends on your application, performance requirements and cost constraints.
