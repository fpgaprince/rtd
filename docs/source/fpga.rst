#################

At the time of writing, focused on Xilinx FPGAs.

What FPGA
***********************
|A chip we pre defined/available building blocks. Your job as a developer is to create the connection between the blocks
|to create some sort of functionality which accomplish some task/application. 

Why FPGA
***********************
Reconfigurability, parallelism, throughput.
I think we have to say throughput, because there are chips faster, but they don't or aren't capable of taking advantage of parallism.

When FPGA
**********************************************
FPGA vs MCU vs CPU vs GPU vs ASIC
==============================================
In general, it depends on your application, performance requirements and cost constraints.
