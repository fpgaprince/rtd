At the time of writing, focused on Xilinx FPGAs.

What is an FPGA
***********************
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are semiconductor devices with pre-defined available logic blocks and programmable interconnect, referred to as its architecture. 
By developing and defining the relationship between the blocks and interonnections (in other words, the logic), 
we can create tasks, functions and/or algorithms specific to an application. 



Why FPGA
***********************
Reconfigurability, parallelism, throughput.
I think we have to say throughput, because there are chips faster, but they don't or aren't capable of taking advantage of parallism.

When FPGA
**********************************************
In general, it depends on your application, performance requirements and cost constraints.

FPGA Dedicated Hardware
**********************************************
As the technology advanced and we are able to fit more onto a die, FPGA began incorporating dedicated hardware, previously external to the FPGA.
