In the way you write HDL..

Speed
    Throughput 
        data or bits per cycel.
        sequential vs. pipelined.. shared resources vs. duplicating resources (increases area)

    Latency
        Cycle count.
        Remove pipeline registers reduces latency, because each register in the path introduces an additional cycle.
        Harder to meet timing

    Timing
        Pipeline the design. in otherwords.. Adding register layers.. 
            Pipelining increase fmax. Decrease delay requirements from register to register.
        Parallelize the design. Analyze function/algorithm, break up into smaller chunks/operations that can be done in parallel.
        Reducing logic level/stages.

Area
    not pipelining. sharing logic resources. remove duplicate logic. use/add control logic, state machine to share sources.
    there are different types of resources. there are the actual FF and LUT that are used to implement your combo logic.
    there are LUT made operations (ie. adder, multiplier, shift) that can be shared, 
    some resources can be pull up to a higher level/hierarchy and be shared across modules, from a global perspective. 
    so resource at the 'module' or component level like clocks and timers..
 
    you do not need a reset for every flip flop or sequential element, it depends what you are doing.
        for instance, you dont need to reset a shift register, if you know you're not going to get valid data until a later time.
        and the circuit/or whatever down stream knows this too. the shift will eventually shift out the initial values set by the FPGA.
        or the garbage input until you get valid.
    
    to use dedicated shift registers, you cannot have a reset signal, they dont have a reset signal. if you do, the tool will
    try to (synth/imp -> syn/imp -> symp) LUT+FF based shift registers. which will take up more resources/area than using dedicated hw.
    more area.

    
Power

FIFO
=======================

Pipeline
=======================
*   Pipelining the design, can increase fmax.
*   Help with Timing
*   Increases latency


Clock Domain Crossing
=======================
    Double Flop. Double Register. Synchronize Flip Flop. All the same, diff names.
    FIFO
    Phase Control, by using the FPGA's PLL/DLL

Reset 
=======================

    Dedicated BRAM and DSP should be synchronously reset because these are dedicated HW in the FPGA. They were 'fabricated' that way, so in order
    to use them correctly.. their resets should be syncrhronous.

    SRL, no reset. Likewise.. frabricated with NO reset pin/input. Therefore if you try to add one, the tool will synthesize extra surrounding logic
    to implement what you, the designer, wants.

    Using set/reset pins can prevent combinatorial logic optimization.

    Asynchronous Reset vs. Synchronous Reset
    Advantage/Disadvantages
    Asynchronous can happen anytime, you dont care about the clock edges. Synchronous is like all the other signals we've dealt with,
    the clock edge we register the reset signal.
    
    The problem with async reset is in releasing the reset signal, starting operation, in relation to the clock. The point is, there is no relation. So when it is released, 
    all the signals in the FPGA start going to work without knowledge of the clock, which creates a recipe for disaster in a synchronous design.
    When we dont have an idea of the clock periods, or edges, we cannot guarantee our setup/hold times, we that is not guaranteed,
    metastability is highly probable.

    The problem with sync reset, is the requirement for a clock. IF for some reason we lose the clock we wont register a reset. Or if logic is spread out through the FPGA
    such that the propagation of the clock is not equal in different areas, we wont reset all at the same time. This will create an uncertainty
    in our reset state/condition.



Clocking
=======================

Static Timing Analysis
=======================

Timing Closure
=======================



Somewhere
=======================
Duplicate logic to reduce fan out (from a register)
    Helps with timing. easier to route, but increases area.

Logic flattening. Understanding the nature of the function/algorithm from a system level.
Knowing the range of input/output? 
Register balancing.
