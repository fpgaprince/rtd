Image and Video Processing 
******************************************
FPGAs excel in video and image processing applications. They are used for tasks such as video compression/decompression, image recognition, and enhancement. FPGAs can be found in cameras, video processing equipment, and displays.


A kernel is basically a matrix which is moved over the image to perform convolution of this kernel matrix and the image data.

In image processing, a kernel, convolution matrix, or mask is a small matrix. It is used for blurring, sharpening, embossing, edge detection, and more. This is accomplished by doing a convolution between a kernel and an image.

In image processing, the kernel size refers to the size of the matrix used for convolution operations on an image. Convolution is a mathematical operation that involves sliding a small matrix, known as a kernel, over an image and calculating the sum of the element-wise product of the kernel and the corresponding image pixels within the kernel.

The kernel size determines the size of the region in the image that is considered for each convolution operation. For example, a 3x3 kernel size means that the convolution operation is performed on a 3x3 pixel region of the image. Common kernel sizes in image processing are 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7.

The choice of kernel size depends on the specific image processing task and the characteristics of the image being processed. A larger kernel size can capture more complex features in the image, but may also result in more computational overhead and slower processing times. A smaller kernel size can be faster but may not capture as much detail in the image.


The figure above shows SOP carried out for a full image being processed. If you look carefully when output pixels are produced line by line, it is not required to have all the image pixels in memory. Only the lines where the filtering mask overlaps are required which is essentially FILTER_V_SIZE lines, which can even be reduced to FILTER_V_SIZE-1. Essentially, that is the amount of data that needs to be on-chip or housed by a data mover at any given time.

Error Detection and correction
********************************************

Forward Error Correction (FEC) encoders are a crucial component in communication systems for enhancing the reliability of data transmission by adding redundant information to correct errors that may occur during transmission. FEC is particularly important in situations where retransmission of erroneous data is not practical or is too costly. Here are several types of FEC encoders commonly used in communication systems:

The choice of FEC encoder depends on factors such as the characteristics of the communication channel, the desired error-correction capabilities, and the complexity of the encoding and decoding processes. In practical communication systems, the use of FEC is often a trade-off between the level of error protection required and the additional bandwidth or processing overhead introduced by the redundant information.

BCH codes are typically defined over a finite field. Choose a finite field GF(2^m) that suits your application. The field size (m) is related to the code parameters.

**Generate the Generator Polynomial:**
Generate the generator polynomial for the BCH code. This polynomial is crucial for encoding. The generator polynomial is typically chosen based on the desired error-correction capability (t).

**Implement Galois Field Operations:**
Implement hardware circuits for basic operations in the finite field, such as addition, multiplication, and inversion. These operations are fundamental for BCH code encoding.

**Message Padding:**
If the message length (k) is less than the code length (n), pad the message with zeros to match the required length.

**Message Polynomial Conversion:**
Convert the message (a binary vector) into a polynomial representation. The coefficients of this polynomial are the bits of the message.

**Encoding Algorithm:**
Implement the BCH encoding algorithm, which involves polynomial multiplication in the finite field. Multiply the message polynomial by the generator polynomial to obtain the codeword polynomial.

**Output Codeword:**
Convert the codeword polynomial back to its binary representation, which is the encoded data.

**Simulation and Verification:**
Simulate the BCH encoder using tools like ModelSim to verify the correctness of the design. Ensure that the generated codewords match the expected results.

**Timing and Pipelining:**
Optimize the design for timing requirements. Consider pipelining certain stages of the encoder to improve throughput and meet timing constraints.

**Test Bench Design:**
Create a comprehensive test bench to thoroughly validate the BCH encoder under various conditions. Test for correct encoding and the ability to detect and correct errors.

**Integration with Communication System:**
Integrate the BCH encoder module into the larger communication system or storage system, ensuring proper interfacing with other components.
