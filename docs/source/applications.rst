Applications
************************

Deeper knowledge in these area will aid in understanding applications of FPGAs.
Remember.. FPGAs are just a means to an end.

Because it is versatile, it is also a cross-section of many different engineering subjects/topics.
NOTE ONLY COVER THAT WHICH YOU'VE DONE. 
other areas will be brief.
