Digital Design
------------------
FPGAs and ASICs share a common nature, that is, digital design logic and elements.. and so many terminology are shared, 
but one must recognize the differences in how they are realized.

We often talk about and show examples with gates in Digital Design, but one must remember, in an FPGA, we are not using gates (although NOT gates do exist in CLBs and throughout to flip bits and help with optimization)
That is.. we're not connecting gates. We are only capturing the logic functionality or behavior.
This functionality can be represented in a truth table (boolean equation) or state equation.
FPGA tools will synthesize and map these equation to LUTs and other digital circuits/elements.

In ASIC Design, designers will deal with gates.
